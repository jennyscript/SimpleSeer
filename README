The SimpleSeer is a way to create inspections and take measurements,
it uses the SimpleCV framework and MongoDB to turn any PC into a vision appliance.

Examples of usage:
==========================

To start SimpleSeer:

    $ cd SimpleSeer
    $ python __init__.py
    >>> SimpleSeer().start()

To capture an image, display, and store in the database:

    >>> frames = SimpleSeer().capture()
    >>> frames[0].image.show()
    >>> frames[0].save()

To retrieve and display all captured frames at a 1 second delay:

    >>> for f in Frame.objects:
    >>>   f.image.show()
    >>>   time.sleep(1)

Installation instructions:
==========================

You must have SimpleCV installed first! http://simplecv.org

You will also need to edit (or copy and edit) default.cfg for settings
that reflect your Camera, database, and etc.

Note: You can optionally install pyfirmata to interface with an arduino

Mac OS X (Using homebrew)
========

> brew install nginx  #nginx conf is slightly different, so you have to set up manually
> brew install mongodb
> brew install redis (and follow directions to install redis as service)
> brew install libevent
> sudo easy_install pip
> sudo pip install -r pip.requirements 
> hg clone https://bitbucket.org/tino/pyfirmata && cd pyfirmata && python setup.py install
> git clone git://github.com/nicolasff/webdis.git && cd webdis && make && sudo make install

Linux (Using apt-get)
=======
> apt-get install mongodb-server nginx libevent-dev
> cp etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
> /etc/init.d/nginx restart
> pip install -r pip.requirements
> wget -O redis.tar.gz "http://redis.googlecode.com/files/redis-2.4.7.tar.gz" && tar zxvf redis.tar.gz && cd redis-2.4.7 && make && sudo make install
> git clone git://github.com/nicolasff/webdis.git && cd webdis && make && sudo make install


[Post Installation]

SuperVisor
============
This is used to start, stop, and autostart processes used for Seer. It should
have been installed as part of the pip requirements but if for some reason
it did not you can run

> sudo pip install supervisor


Then you need to copy the config file:

> cp etc/supervisord.conf /etc/


Now you should be able to run:

> sudo supervisord

and it should start redis, webdis, and any other external processes SimpleSeer
may require.  To make sure they are running type:

> pgrep redis

If it is running you should get a process number in return.

To have supervisor automatically start (so it starts all your processes)
do the following:

> sudo cp etc/supervisord /etc/init.d/
> sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/supervisord
> sudo update-rc.d supervisord defaults


*NOTE: Don't install python-pymongo from the repos as it is much too far out of date and requires 2+
