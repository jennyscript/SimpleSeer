The SimpleSeer is a way to create inspections and take measurements,
it uses the SimpleCV framework and MongoDB to turn any PC into a vision appliance.

Examples of usage:
==========================

To start SimpleSeer in continuous mode:

    $ cd SimpleSeer
    $ python __init__.py
    >>> SimpleSeer().start()

To capture an image, display, and store in the database:

    >>> frames = SimpleSeer().capture()
    >>> frames[0].image.show()
    >>> frames[0].save()

To retrieve and display all captured frames at a 1 second delay:

    >>> for f in Frame.objects:
    >>>   f.image.show()
    >>>   time.sleep(1)

Installation instructions:
